# DNNSIM: Deep Monotonic Single-Index Model

This repository hosts supplementary materials and simulation code for the **DNNSIM** R package, available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DNNSIM/index.html). The package implements a monotonic single-index model using deep neural networks for robust modal regression, especially suited for skewed and heavy-tailed data.

**Abstract**: This work proposes a deep monotonic single-index model with a flexible two-piece scale Student-\(t\) distribution, providing a robust alternative for analyzing skewed and heavy-tailed data. The proposed model ensures theoretical guarantees, outlier resistance, and interpretability via parametric index coefficients.
